# gcjs

This is a reusable JavaScript module that exposes a <tt>gcjs.GDriveCollab</tt> class that uses
the [fmjs.GDriveFileManagerâ€™s](https://github.com/FNNDSC/fmjs) functionality and the GDrive
Realtime REST API to implement real-time collaboration.

The real-time collaboration is actually implemented by making the application data to be kept in sync
among collaborators part of the GDrive Realtime Collaborative Data Model (RT-CDM). The <tt>gcjs.GDriveCollab</tt>
class provides methods to get and set the RT-CDM and five event listeners that can be dynamically overwritten
on its object instances:

* onConnect: called by all connected instances just after a new instance connects to the collaboration session
* onDataFilesShared: called by all connected instances everytime the collaboration owner has share all its GDrive
data files with a new collaborator
* onCollabObjChanged: called on all connected instances every time the RT-CDM is updated by any remote collaborator
* onNewChatMessage: called on all connected instances everytime a new chat message is received from a remote collaborator
* onDisconnect: called on all connected instances everytime a remote collaborator disconnects from the collaboration session

Take a look at [viewerjs](https://github.com/FNNDSC/viewerjs) as an example project that uses a
<tt>gcjs.GDriveCollab</tt> object.
